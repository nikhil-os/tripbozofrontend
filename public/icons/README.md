# Icons Directory

This directory contains the icons used for the Trip Bozo PWA and website.

The main logo file is already available at `/public/logo.png`, but for a complete PWA implementation, you should create and place the following icon files in this directory:

- `android-chrome-192x192.png` (192x192px)
- `android-chrome-512x512.png` (512x512px)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180px)
- `favicon-32x32.png` (32x32px)
- `favicon-16x16.png` (16x16px)
- `favicon.ico` (multi-size: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
- `mstile-150x150.png` (150x150px)

Use a tool like [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create all these icons from your logo file.

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and in the website's HTML to provide proper PWA support and branding across different platforms and devices.
