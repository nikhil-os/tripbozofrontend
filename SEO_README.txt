# Trip Bozo SEO & Codebase Enhancement Summary

## What Was Done
- Enhanced `components/SEO.js` to inject:
  - `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<meta name="keywords">`, canonical, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and JSON-LD structured data using `next/head` and `next/script`.
  - Accept dynamic props for title, description, url, image, and keywords.
- Updated `components/countryapp/CountryAppsPage.js`:
  - Imported and used the `SEO` component at the top.
  - Dynamically generated meta tags (title, description, keywords) using the country name, country code, and all app names for that country (from the CSVs).
- Updated About and Home pages to use the `SEO` component with relevant static/dynamic props.
- Ensured `public/robots.txt` allows all crawlers and points to the sitemap.
- Ensured `public/sitemap.xml` lists all important country pages and is up to date.
- Fixed JSX/React errors in `CountryAppsPage.js`.
- All changes are non-breaking and build is error-free.

## How to Use the SEO Component
```
<SEO
  type="WebPage"
  title={`France Travel Apps | Best Apps for Tourists & Locals | Trip Bozo`}
  description={`Best travel, food, hotel, weather, and essential apps for France. Discover and download top apps like City Mapper, Uber Eats France, and more for your trip to France.`}
  url={`https://tripbozo.com/country/FR`}
  image={heroImages[0] || 'https://tripbozo.com/logo.png'}
  keywords={'France, FR, City Mapper, Uber Eats France, ...'}
/>
```
- For country/app pages, dynamically generate `title`, `description`, and `keywords` using country/app data.
- For static pages (About, Home), use relevant static props.

## Validation
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to ensure zero errors.
- All SEO tags are present in the HTML output.

## Why These Changes?
- Maximize Google discoverability for every country and app.
- Ensure every page has unique, rich, and relevant metadata.
- Enable rich results (cards, breadcrumbs, etc.) via structured data.
- Prevent duplicate content and crawling issues.
- Ensure a professional, production-ready build with zero errors.
